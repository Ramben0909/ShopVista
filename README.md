GitHub Collaboration Workflow
This document outlines the collaboration workflow we will follow for contributing to the project. Please ensure to follow the steps for smooth collaboration and to avoid conflicts.

1. Clone the Repository
To begin contributing to the project, clone the repository to your local machine using:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repositoryname.git
This will set up your local copy of the repository and automatically link the remote origin to the shared GitHub repository.

2. Create a New Branch
Before making any changes, always create a new branch for your task or feature:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b feature-branch-name
Replace feature-branch-name with a descriptive name for the feature or task (e.g., add-login, update-footer).
3. Make Changes Locally
Make the necessary changes in your local environment. Once your changes are done, stage and commit them:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Short description of the changes"
4. Pull the Latest Changes from main
Before pushing your changes, it is essential to pull the latest updates from the shared repository to avoid merge conflicts. Here's how to do it:

Switch to main branch:

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
Pull the latest changes:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
Switch back to your branch:

bash
Copy code
git checkout feature-branch-name
Merge the latest changes from main into your branch (if necessary):

bash
Copy code
git merge main
This ensures your branch is up-to-date with the latest changes from main.

5. Push Your Branch to GitHub
After making sure your branch is up to date and there are no conflicts, push your changes to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push origin feature-branch-name
6. Create a Pull Request (PR)
After pushing your branch to GitHub, you need to create a Pull Request to merge your changes into the main branch:

Go to the repository on GitHub.
Navigate to the Pull Requests tab.
Click New Pull Request.
Select your feature-branch-name to merge into main.
Add a title and description for your PR.
Submit the Pull Request.
7. Code Review and Merge
Other collaborators will review the Pull Request. Once approved, the branch can be merged into main. If there are any conflicts, you may need to resolve them locally and update the Pull Request.

8. Pull the Latest Changes After the Merge
Once the Pull Request is merged, everyone should pull the latest changes from main to keep their local copies updated:

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
git pull origin main
This ensures that your local repository is in sync with the latest version of the project.
